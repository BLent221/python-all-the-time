#The task is as follows: You are going to create a program that first asks the user to
#enter text. It can be any text, an entire article, a paragraph, a sentence, a poem,
#whatever you want. Then the program will ask the user to enter three random letters.
#From that moment on, our code is going to process that information and result in five
#different types of analysis: 


user = input("Enter your desired text here: ")
letter = []

user = user.lower()
letter.append(input("Enter your first letter here: ").lower())
letter.append(input("Enter your second letter here: ").lower())
letter.append(input("Enter your third letter here: ").lower())

print("\n")
print("Letter repetition: ")

letter_rep1 = user.count(letter[0])
letter_rep2 = user.count(letter[1])
letter_rep3 = user.count(letter[2])

print(f"We have found that this letter {letter[0]} repeaed {letter_rep1} times: ")
print(f"We have found that this letter {letter[1]} repeaed {letter_rep2} times: ")
print(f"We have found that this letter {letter[2]} repeaed {letter_rep3} times: ")

user_change = user.split()

print(f"This is the amount of words in the whole paragraph: {len(user_change)}")

user_start1 = user_change[0]
user_start2 = user_change[-1]

print(f"This the fisr word of the paragraph: {user_start1}")
print(f"And this is the last: {user_start2}")

user_change.reverse()
join_us = " ".join(user_change)

print(f"This is the paragraph reversed: {join_us}")

print("python" in user)
