# If the number the user said is less than 1 or greater than 100, it will tell them that
#he/she has chosen a number that is out of play.

# If the number the user chose is less than the number the program thought of, it will tell
#them that the answer is wrong, and that he/she chose a lower number than the secret
#number.

# If the user chose a number greater than the secret number, it will let them know that it
#was greater.

# And if the user got the secret number right, they will be informed that they have won,
#and how many tries that has taken them.

# If the user has not guessed correctly in their first attempt, they will be asked again to
#choose another number and so on until they win or until their eight attempts are done.
